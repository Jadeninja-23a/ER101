# ER101
## Hello everyone, and welcome to ER 101!
Have you ever been amazed by how electronics actually work? Like, how are phones, laptops, or robots even possible? It’s crazy to think that something as small as moving electrons and electric fields somehow powers all the tech we use every day — from gaming and social media to automation and AI.

It almost feels like magic… but it’s not. It’s science — and humans figured it out.

So, where do you begin if you want to really understand how computers and electronics work? Right here.

The Electronics and Robotics Club of IIT Bombay brings you ER 101 — a beginner-friendly roadmap to help you build a solid foundation in electronics and get a clear picture of how we use electricity to process information and build the tech around us.

### To kick things off, here’s an excellent playlist that covers the fundamentals of digital electronics.
We’ll be referring to specific video numbers from this playlist throughout our journey in ER 101, so I highly recommend going through it as we progress. It’s genuinely one of the most well-structured and informative resources out there.

[▶️ Link to the Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwjK_iyK4LLBC_so3odA64E2MLgIRKafl&si=oMMceoZ6F5fteiB8)

This playlist is an absolute goldmine — don’t overlook it. It’ll make a big difference in how clearly you understand the concepts ahead.

### Here’s another great resource to explore digital electronics.
If you prefer reading over videos — or want to explore certain topics in a different format — this GeeksforGeeks resource is a great alternative.

[📚 Digital Electronics Articles on GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-electronics-logic-design-tutorials/)

It’s well-structured, beginner-friendly, and covers a wide range of topics in digital electronics. Definitely worth exploring if you enjoy learning by reading.

### 🔌 Try It Yourself — Simulations for Hands-On Practice

We’ll guide you through the concepts in this course, but if you *really* want to understand how things work, you’ve got to try them out yourself.  
Here are some platforms where you can experiment and build your own circuits:

---

#### 🧠 For Digital Logic Circuit Simulation

- 🔗 [**CircuitVerse**](https://circuitverse.org)  
  A beginner-friendly simulator for building and testing **digital logic circuits** — think logic gates, adders, flip-flops, counters, etc.

---

#### ⚙️ For Real-World Electronics & Arduino Simulation

- 🔗 [**Wokwi**](https://wokwi.com)  
  A powerful browser-based simulator for **Arduino**, ESP32, and more — great for real-world electronics and embedded systems.

- 🔗 [**TinkerCAD Circuits**](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits)  
  Simple and intuitive tool to simulate **basic electronics and Arduino setups**. Good for quick prototyping and testing ideas.

## 🔌 What is Digital Electronics?
Digital electronics is the part of electronics that deals with systems using digital signals — signals that can only be 1 (high) or 0 (low).

Why just two values? Because it makes things much more reliable. Unlike analog signals that can be messy and affected by noise, digital signals are clear and easy to work with — which is why almost all modern devices like phones, laptops, and calculators are built using them.

## The Language of Digital Electronics: Binary
In digital electronics, everything comes down to 0s and 1s — they represent the low and high signals in a circuit. That’s why it’s important to understand the binary number system early on. Computers and digital devices store and handle all kinds of data — numbers, text, images — using just these two values. So, if you want to really get how digital systems work, binary is where it all begins.

Here are some great resources to get you started :
- [Number Systems and Base Conversions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-system-and-base-conversions/)  
  Understand binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal systems — and how to convert between them.

- [Binary Arithmetic](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-number-system/)  
  Learn how addition, subtraction, and multiplication work in binary.

- [2’s Complement and Signed Representation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-representations-in-digital-logic/)  
  Explore how negative numbers are handled using 1’s and 2’s complement.'

### 🎯 Side Quest (Optional, but Super Cool)

Want to go a bit deeper or explore some bonus topics? These are not mandatory, but definitely fun to look into:

- **Gray Code, XS-3, BCD**  
  → [BCD](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bcd-or-binary-coded-decimal/)
    Represents each decimal digit separately in 4-bit binary. Easy to read, used in displays.
  
  → [XS-3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/excess-3-code/)
    Adds 3 to each digit before converting to binary. Helps avoid negative values in circuits.
  
  → [Gray Code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-gray-code/)
    Only one bit changes between consecutive numbers. Reduces errors in sensors and encoders.
  
    📼 *Videos 17–29 in the playlist*
  

- **Hamming Code (Error Correction)**  
  [Hamming Codes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hamming-code-in-computer-network/) Learn how data can be checked and corrected — used in memory systems, communication, and more.  
  📼 *Videos 20–24 in the playlist*
